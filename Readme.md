## üõ†Ô∏è Browser Agent Tools

The agent uses these specialized tools to control the browser:

| Tool                | Description                                                             | Example                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **analyze_page**    | Scans the DOM to create a map of all visible elements with numbered IDs | `analyze_page()`                                                 |
| **click**           | Clicks on elements using IDs from the page analysis                     | `click("[3][button]Submit")`                                     |
| **fill_input**      | Fills text into input fields                                            | `fill_input('{"id":"5","type":"input","value":"example text"}')` |
| **select_option**   | Selects options from dropdown menus                                     | `select_option('{"id":"8","value":"Option 2"}')`                 |
| **keyboard_action** | Sends keyboard shortcuts and special keys                               | `keyboard_action("Enter")`                                       |
| **navigate**        | Opens a URL in the browser                                              | `navigate("https://example.com")`                                |
| **go_back**         | Navigates to the previous page in browser history                       | `go_back()`                                                      |
| **scroll**          | Scrolls the viewport in specified directions                            | `scroll("down")`                                                 |
| **ask_user**        | Requests information from the user during task execution                | `ask_user('{"prompt":"Enter password","type":"password"}')`      |

### How Element References Work

When the agent analyzes a page, it assigns numeric IDs to each interactive element:

```
[1][button]Sign Up
[2][link]Learn More
[3][input]Search
```

The agent can then reference these elements by their ID, type, and text:

```
click("[1][button]Sign Up")
```

## üîß Technical Details

### AI Agent Framework

The Browser Agent is built on LangGraph, a stateful workflow framework for LLM applications. The agent uses a GPT model from Azure OpenAI with specialized tools for browser control.

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent Workflow</strong></summary>

1. **Instruction Processing**: The LLM parses the natural language instruction
2. **Tool Selection**: The agent decides which browser tools to use
3. **Action Execution**: The agent executes actions sequentially
4. **Progress Monitoring**: The agent tracks state changes and adapts
5. **Result Generation**: The agent compiles results for the user
</details>

### Browser Automation

The system uses Playwright for browser automation, providing cross-browser compatibility and powerful DOM manipulation capabilities.

### Element Detection

The Page Analyzer uses advanced JavaScript to scan the DOM and identify interactive elements, creating a numbered map of elements that the agent can reference with precise IDs.

## üö® Error Handling

The Browser Agent employs sophisticated error handling:

- **Element Detection**: Re-analysis after scrolling or waiting for dynamic content
- **Click Failures**: Alternative selection strategies and visibility checks
- **Navigation Issues**: Error detection and recovery for failed navigations
- **Form Validation**: Reading and addressing validation errors
- **Session Management**: Detection and handling of timeouts and authentication issues

## üîç Advanced Usage

### Connecting to Existing Chrome Instances

You can connect the Browser Agent to an already running Chrome instance:

1. Launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled:

   ```bash
   python main.py launch --port 9222
   ```

2. Configure the Browser Agent to use the existing instance:

   ```python
   # In configurations/config.py
   BROWSER_CONNECTION = {
       "use_existing": True,
       "cdp_endpoint": "http://localhost:9222",
   }
   ```

3. Run the Browser Agent:
   ```bash
   python main.py run
   ```

### Creating Multi-Step Automated Workflows

You can chain multiple instructions into a single workflow:

```bash
python main.py run --task "Go to gmail.com, wait for the login page,
enter the username 'test@example.com', click next, wait for the password field,
ask me for the password, enter it, and click sign in"
```

### User Interaction During Execution

The agent can prompt for user input during execution:

```python
# Example of how the agent uses the ask_user tool
ask_user('{"prompt":"Please enter your 2FA code","type":"text"}')
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Browser Connection Issues</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Unable to connect to Chrome with debugging enabled

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure Chrome is not already running with the same debugging port
2. Try a different port: `python main.py launch --port 9223`
3. Check firewall settings that might block the connection
4. Verify Chrome is installed in the default location or set the path manually
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Page Analysis Problems</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Agent can't find or interact with elements on the page

**Solutions**:

1. Give the page more time to load completely before analyzing
2. For dynamic content, ask the agent to scroll and re-analyze
3. Make your element references more specific
4. For highly dynamic sites, try slowing down agent actions with the `slowmo` option
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authentication Challenges</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Agent can't handle login procedures with CAPTCHA or 2FA

**Solutions**:

1. Pre-authenticate in the browser before connecting the agent
2. Use the `ask_user` tool to get manual input for verification challenges
3. Consider using cookies or saved sessions for sites you access frequently
</details>
